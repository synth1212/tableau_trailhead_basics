## Reflection
One principle from Data Storytelling with Tableau Public that I found most important was the idea of keeping the message simple and direct, which helped me to create a clear comparison between partner types and a straightforward trend across states. From The Tableau Data Model, the key concept that stood out was the importance of using relationships instead of joins when possible, because relationships preserve original data granularity and avoid duplication, which is something essential when working with real-world datasets, like issuer and partner lists. Applying this concept ensured that each partner record was counted accurately when building my bar and line charts. In a healthcare context, Tableau’s data model and storytelling tools would be especially useful for tracking patient outcomes across multiple related tables, such as visits, diagnoses, and lab results. Tableau is a good fit for these scenarios because it can highlight trends, and patterns across large datasets in a way that supports quick decision-making for clinicians, administrators, etc.
